AST Resulting From Parsing Stage:
ClassDecl (name: A, superClass: Object)

Error message from reference is: No type 'C' was found
Error message: TYPE_ERROR

Phase semantic failed because we expected to see:
NO_SUCH_TYPE
But we actually saw:
TYPE_ERROR
The difference is:
At line   1 /   1:
< NO_SUCH_TYPE
> TYPE_ERROR
